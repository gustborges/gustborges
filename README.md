### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸš€ About Me

I'm **Gustavo Borges**, a **Full-Stack Web Developer** since 2020 - mainly working with Ruby on Rails, but also with some experience in frontend frameworks like React, Next.js and Vue.js. My background: I've graduated on Social Communications, specialized in Advertising, and have two post-graduations: Digital Design and a Marketing MBA. During my whole career (20+ years), I had the chance to work in big, medium and small companies/projects, to experience different kinds of challenges and even begin my own company while traveling the world. I'm naturally an adventurous and curious person, always willing to learn more and I'm very passionate about my work.
